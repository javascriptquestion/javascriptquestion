JavaScript is a loosely typed language. 
This means that you can use the same variable for different types of information, 
but you may also have to check what type a variable is yourself, if the differences matter. 
For example, if you wanted to add two numbers, but one variable turned out to be a string, 
the result wouldn't necessarily be what you expected.
